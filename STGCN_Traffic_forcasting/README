We propose a novel deep learning framework, 
STGCN, to tackle time series prediction problem in 
traffic domain. Instead of applying regular convolutional
and recurrent units, we formulate the problem on graphs and 
build the model with complete convolutional structures.
To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that to 
apply purely convolutional structures to extract spatio-temporal 
features simultaneously from graph-structured time series 
in a traffic study.
